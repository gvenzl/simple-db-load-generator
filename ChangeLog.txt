SimpleLoadGenerator - Change Log - (c) Gerald Venzl

v2.0.0

Changes:

* Migration to GitHub
* Migration to Java 8

v1.1.0

Changes:

* Include ChangeLog
* Capability of parsing MySql general log files
* Capability of parsing Multi-Line text files
* Removed parse error count - Previously the program stopped after 1000 parse errors in order to prevent useless parallel invalid SQL execution.
This changed for TextFile Multi line support where a line in between a SQL command can be anything.
It is assumed that:
a) MySql general log format won't change
b) The user verified the SQLs before he added them into the plain text files!  

Bugfixes:

* MySql general log file: Replace "`" character in SQL strings - MySql masks all columns with "`" in the output file but those don't parse as prepared statements and have to be trimmed. 
* Corrected online help; session parameter was missing
